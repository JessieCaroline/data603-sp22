# K-Fold Cross Validation Technique
* In this research paper, I will be discussing about K-Fold Cross Validation Technique in which we split the data into k-subsets and the holdout method is repeated k-times where each of the k subsets are used as test set and other k-1 subsets are used for the training purpose. 
### I will be discussing the below topics
* Life Cycle of K-Fold Cross-Validation
*  Thumb Rules Associated with K Fold 
*  Model Selection using K-Fold 
*  Parameter Tuning Using K-Fold
*  K-Fold in Visual form 
*  K-Fold cross validation technique with a examples.
