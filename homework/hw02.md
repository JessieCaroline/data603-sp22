# NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models
## Drawbacks in Relational Database Management Systems
* it is difficult to scale a relational database horizontally. Horizontal scaling is adding machines to existing stack to handle traffic and fast processing. 
* it is difficult to maintain consistency while scaling up.
* restricted datatypes in table.
* Can't handle unstructured data.
### NoSQL was coined, it doesn’t need SQL to manage the data. There are 4 types of NoSQL Databases.
* Key-value store: Associative arrays are stored and managed in key-value databases (Ex: MemcacheDB)
* Columnar databases are database systems that store data in columns. (EX: Apache)
* Document-oriented databases store data in document form. (Ex: MongoDB)
* Graph database is a subcategory of document store database but doesn’t insist data to a predefined schema. (Ex: Neo4j)

# Data Lake
#### A data lake is a central repository that houses a large amount of data in its original, raw form.
#### Data lake Advantages
* can handle any type of data. 
* enable you to convert unstructured data into structured data.
* extremely adaptable, allowing to perform multiple analytics tasks at the same time
#### Data lake disadvantages
* reliability issues
* slow performance
* low security
#### Lakehouse overcomes these drawbacks by adding transactional storage on top layer
#### Delta lake is an open format data management. It eliminates data silos and makes analytics accessible. It is highly scalable and cost efficient.
